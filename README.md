# Synthesia Editor Challenge

I'll be tackling this challenge in a bottom up approach, making use of storybook I will create an initial set of components for the gallery and the editor using mocked data. I will then compose these into pages and hook them up to use data fetched from `pisum.photos`.

With these type of taks I like to pick new libraries to play with. I usually use `Chakra` for web apps and `NativeBase` for mobile apps, so to expand my horizons and because you metioned you use `materialui`, I will use it for this challenge.

My data visualisation has been limited to `react-table` and `highcharts` for the past years, so using `canvas` for this challenge will be very interesting.
